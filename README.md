# django-serverless



## To Run Locally:

(for me personally, I had to run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` to execute the active script on Windows11, or you can open powershell as admin)

```
cd django/simply/simply
virtualenv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
venv/Scripts/activate (and simply write `deactivate` to close down the virtualenv)
python manage.py runserver
```

And you can write `deactivate` to shut down the virtual environment
